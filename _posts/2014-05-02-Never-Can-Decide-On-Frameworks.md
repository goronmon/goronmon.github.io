title: Never Can Decide on Frameworks
---

One of the toughest things about side projects, personally, is that I always seem to want to change frameworks whenever I pick up a project I haven't touched in a while. Whether it's switching from different web application frameworks within a language, a different language, or in the case of games to different game engine. Overall, I believe I've probably spent more time researching and deciding on which frameworks to use then I've spent actually making progress on new applications and games.

I guess there must be something I like about the initial research phase, as if at some point I will come across a framework or engine that will be both easy to learn and solve all the previous problems I've had with older attempts. Unfortunately, in reality it mostly means that each time I switch to something knew I'm stuck spending my time learning what drawbacks I've traded for. Here's to hoping that I can rid myself of this habit in the near future.
