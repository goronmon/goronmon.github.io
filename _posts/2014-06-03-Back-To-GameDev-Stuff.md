title: Back to GameDev Stuff

While I didn't get super far with my Dark Souls 2 game save tool, at least it felt like I was able to make decent progress on at least one solution, as terrible as it might have been. It's interesting how little information is out there for making basic Windows applications these days. I guess with the switch to Windows 8 things are only going to get more complicated in the future.

So, it's back to actually trying to make some sort of game. Still not able to decide on what type of Javascript framework I might want to use. Gets frustrating going through this everytime I want to do something game related.

Maybe I should just go all out and stick with something like Unity.
