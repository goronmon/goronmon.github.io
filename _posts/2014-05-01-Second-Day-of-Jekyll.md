title: Second Day of Jekyll
---

I'm on the second of trying out Jekyll for a basic blogging setup. Feels more like development than standard writing, which feels better for some reason. Also, tryin to use vim for more editing so that I can try to learn more useful habits. Going half decent so far, but I still feel like I am barely scratching the surface of how I should be using it.
