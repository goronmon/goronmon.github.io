title: Started a Whole New Project
---

As yet another example of my constant indecision as far as what I want to work on, I have shifted to yet another new project. This one at least was very limited in scope. I wanted to try my hand at creating a basic save backup application for Dark Souls 2 saves. Things are going well, but wanting to try using Visual Studio means I'm basically limited to either console applications or Windows Forms applications. Either isn't exactly cutting edge technology but at least the WinForms stuff is pretty straight-forward if you just want to create something functional.
