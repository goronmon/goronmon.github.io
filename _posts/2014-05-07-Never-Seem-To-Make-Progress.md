title: Never Seem to Make Progress
---

I can never seem to make a lot of progress with my personal development projects. I'm always getting trapped dealing with all the extraneous development stuff. I've mentioned my prior problem of always wanting to switch development frameworks. Unfortunately, my delays aren't just limited to those decisons. Currently I'm playing around with Meteor, which doesn't have official Windows support. Which means I have VirtualBox running through Windows with a copy of Ubuntu on the VM. So I already have that amount of complication to keep track of.

Then it comes down to DVCS. Generally I've used Mercurial through BitBucket in the past, but I'm most likely making the decision to switch to Git for everything. But my existing worked is saved in a Mercurial repository, so now I am figuring how to make the switch. Again, instead of actually doing some coding and learning some stuff I'm stuck hacking around getting version control to work. Sure, that's learning in its own right, but I want to actually get some development stuff done so that I have something to show for it. Not just a well-organized, but mostly empty repository.
